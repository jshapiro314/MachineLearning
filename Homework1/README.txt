I worked with Lora Sidorovich and Karl Preisner.

All written work is located in "Homework 1 Written Portion.pdf"

Matlab functions include the following:
knn.m
perceptron_test.m
perceptron_train.m
calculateClassMean.m

Matlab scripts include the following (call these to run all code for perceptron and KNN):
perceptronTest.m
knnPlots.m
