I worked with Lora Sidorovich and Karl Preisner.

All written work is located in "Homework 3 Written Portion.pdf"

Matlab functions include the following:
kernelPerceptron.m
EM.m -- taken from the solutions to homework2
classifyGaussians.m

Matlab scripts include the following (call these to run all code):
q3a.m
q3b.m
q3c.m
q3d.m

They correspond to question 3, parts a-d respectively.
